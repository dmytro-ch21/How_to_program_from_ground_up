# Conclusion

## Programming Paradigms are Just Different Styles to Structure and Organize Software
  - The different paradigms are not better or worse than each other, they are just different styles to structure the
    state and behavior of software to provide a solution.
  - Paradigms are not independent, Different paradigms can be combined together to create a program that is easier to understand and maintain.
  - Paradigms are not frozen and are constantly evolving as new ideas are added to the software development
    methods to make creating software easier and more effective.
  - Each paradigm has their own trade-offs and costs that must be considered when
    choosing which paradigm is appropriate for a particular problem. Sometimes, the best solution is the simplest one.
  - Paradigms are not dogma, and should not be followed blindly, but should be used as a guide to help
    structure and organization the program to be easiest to understand and change.
 
## You can only learn programming by actually programming
  - The best way to learn programming is to actually program. You can read all the books and watch all the videos
    you want, but you will not learn programming until you actually start solving problems.
  - Doing "code katas" and "coding challenges" are a great way to practice programming and learn new programming
    languages and paradigms.
  - But after you know the mechanics, the bigger challenge is to learn how to structure and organize the state and
    behavior of the software to be easiest to understand and change.
  - This is a life-long learning process, and how to arrange ideas and concepts to make them easier to understand
    and change is a skill that takes time and practice to develop, and only comes with experience and practice.

    > BEWARE THE TUTORIAL TAR-PIT
    > - Always code-along with the tutorial, and change it afterwards to make sure you understand.
    > - If you just watch, it **_WILL BE_** a **_COMPLETE_** waste of time, even though you _**THINK**_ you understand it.

## Programming Will Always Be a Human Activity - AI Cannot Possibly Solve Everything and Requires Human Guidance
  - Solution methods will become a bit more abstract in the future using tools like GitHub copilot, but the
    programmer will still need to know all these details to get the machine to do EXACTLY what they want it to do.
  - We are always going to need people who have various tastes and understandings about humans and the world to
    create software that is useful and effective FOR THOSE PARTICULAR HUMANS.
