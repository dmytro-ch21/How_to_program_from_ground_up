# THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IN COMPUTING - What Are We Representing with Digital Information?
- Everything in computing is REPRESENTING digital information "as" something _else_.
- Kinds of representations through history:

    - ## Punched Holes in a paper card - 1800s to 1970s
        - Vast improvement over the paper ledger
        - Collection of data was standardized, fast and could be read by a machine
        - Data collected from the 1890 US Census was the first large scale use of punched cards
        - Allowed for the first "programmable" machines that could be used to perform relatively complex tasks
          like sorting and counting of specific data

- ## Creating ANY machine capable of using "Boolean Logic" enables humans to create complex, custom general solutions to certain kinds of problems.
    - The problems must be able to be represented with binary information and the solution must be able to be
      represented with a series of logical operations.
    - By building up from the simple logic of `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operations, humans can create an
      arbitrarily complex sequence of logical operations.
    - These logical operations are sequenced in time to create ["State Machines"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lffJJbqt1fk) that can perform complex tasks
      and solve complex problems. A state machine is simply a way of representing the problem that changes over time
      controlled by a series of logical operations & conditions that lead to certain states and available actions.
    - These logical operations are built up using patterns called "algorithms" grouped together in "programs" that
      can be executed by any digital computer, no matter what the underlying hardware is.

      > ## All of this "technology" is based on human ingenuity and cleverness to exploit certain properties of naturally occurring phenomenon in a way to create some "useful human work".
      >> ### The machines cannot possibly "know" anything about the problem or solution, and NEVER WILL.

      ### It's just following the logical operations that humans have carefully designed to represent the problem and represent a solution.

- ## Spiral Model of Development of Techniques in Computing
  - As knowledge and techniques in computing have developed, they have built upon each other in a spiral pattern.
    
    [<img src="assets/spiral_model.png" width="400">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model)
  - Ideas and techniques from the past are often re-discovered and re-used in new ways.
